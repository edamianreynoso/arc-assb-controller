# ASSB/APRB v1: Affective Stability & Recovery Benchmark for Controlled Internal-State Agents

**Date:** 2025-12-12

## Abstract
We propose a minimal benchmark and evaluation protocol for agents endowed with internal affective and narrative state
variables. The benchmark focuses on recovery after perturbations (stress, uncertainty, reward shocks, goal shifts), and on
rumination-like loops induced by elevated narrative gain (DMN proxy). We provide simulation code, metrics (Recovery Time,
Overshoot, Rumination Index), and baseline controllers including an Affective Regulation Core (ARC v1).

## Hypotheses (v1)
H1: ARC v1 yields lower recovery time than baselines across scenarios.
H2: ARC v1 reduces rumination index under uncertainty compared to baselines.
H3: ARC v1 reduces arousal overshoot without degrading mean performance.
